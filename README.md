# learner-hub
An open source learning management application

## About the project

This is an open source project to build an LMS (learning management system) application. The goal of the project is to learn several design aspects that are needed to build a SAAS application. There are several goals that i've set for myself before starting to work on the application

- Use microservices
- Do not use Java, use nodejs or python to build the microservices layer (just for fun)
- Do not use ReactJS, Angular or Vue JS for frontend layer. Lets build this application with a new framework.
- Use unit testing and TDD based approach
- Create an devops pipeline for future contributers
- Start with a well defined domain model
- Use observability, so that application can be monitored using OpenTelemetry
- Use an headless cms for defining contents
- Deploy the setup on kubernetes
- Have an SAAS mindset
